# Oh My Winuxsh

Official Oh My-style plugin framework and bundled plugin distribution for
Winuxsh.

This repository is not a zsh runtime and does not provide zsh plugin
compatibility. It should, however, follow the useful shape of Oh My Zsh, fish
plugin managers, and PowerShell prompt frameworks: plugins are directories,
themes are plugins, and the shell core provides loader primitives instead of
owning high-level plugin behavior.

## Status

The active direction is framework-first. See [docs/design.md](docs/design.md).
The earlier manifest-first bundle design is retired in
[docs/design-manifest-first-retired.md](docs/design-manifest-first-retired.md).

- Winuxsh owns shell primitives, plugin loading, lifecycle dispatch, permission
  review, update/rollback, and fast native helpers.
- `oh-my-winuxsh` owns framework libraries, plugin directories, themes, default
  composition, and the official bundled distribution.
- Bundled plugins may ship with Winuxsh, but bundled does not mean built in.
- `plugin.toml` is metadata for packaging, review, and updates. It should not be
  the only way to express local trusted shell behavior.

## Framework Model

The target interactive setup is directory-first and familiar:

```sh
WINUXSH_PLUGINS=(prompt-core git docker zoxide)
WINUXSH_THEME=minimal
source "$WINUXSH/oh-my-winuxsh.winux"
```

Managed TOML should map onto the same plugin system:

```toml
[plugins]
enabled = true
bundles = ["oh-my-winuxsh"]
load = ["prompt-core", "git", "docker", "zoxide"]

[theme]
current_theme = "minimal"

[plugins.git]
enabled = true
permissions = ["shell:source", "cwd:read", "process:run:git"]
```

The bundle is still expected to ship with Winuxsh releases so users have an
offline baseline, then update independently:

```sh
winuxsh plugin update oh-my-winuxsh --from dist\oh-my-winuxsh-1.0.1.zip --checksum-file dist\oh-my-winuxsh-1.0.1.zip.sha256
winuxsh plugin rollback oh-my-winuxsh
```

User shell code and normal plugin/theme selection belong in `~/.winuxshrc`.
`~/.winshrc` is only a legacy fallback when `~/.winuxshrc` is absent:

```sh
alias ll='ls -la'
export EDITOR=vim
```

## Transitional Packs

`packs/`, `aliases/`, `completions/`, `prompts/`, `keybindings/`, and
`themes/` remain in the repository because current Winuxsh releases and release
tools still understand the manifest-first bundle layout. New behavior should
land in `plugins/<name>/` first, then expose metadata through TOML for review,
managed install, update, and rollback.

The old `prompts` and `themes` packs are compatibility assets. They are no
longer the product model for prompt and theme behavior; `prompt-core` and
`theme-*` plugins are.

## Authoring

Public authoring is moving to plugin directories. During the transition,
[docs/authoring.md](docs/authoring.md) still describes the manifest-backed
bundle surface and templates, but new user-facing behavior should start as
plugin-owned code/assets rather than Winuxsh `builtin` packs.

```sh
python tools/validate_bundle.py
python tools/package_bundle.py --check
winuxsh plugin review <pack>
winuxsh plugin search devtools
winuxsh plugin themes
winuxsh plugin install git
winuxsh plugin doctor
```

`plugin.toml` remains useful for package metadata, permissions, exports, and
required binaries before Winuxsh runs distributed plugin code. It should be a
review/install surface over plugin directories, not the product identity.

## Legacy

The old repository content was a `.winsh` script framework from a previous
WinSH era. It is preserved through the `legacy-pre-winuxsh-plugin-system`
branch/tag; the active branch describes the official Winuxsh plugin bundle.

See [docs/migration.md](docs/migration.md).

## Roadmap

The active product direction lives in [docs/design.md](docs/design.md). The old
phase roadmap remains in [docs/roadmap.md](docs/roadmap.md) as manifest-first
history until the framework-first migration plan replaces it.
Release compatibility is tracked in [docs/compatibility.md](docs/compatibility.md),
and bundle changes are tracked in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Validation And Packaging

```sh
python tools/validate_bundle.py
python tools/package_bundle.py --check
# Windows launcher:
py tools\validate_bundle.py
py tools\package_bundle.py --check
# Runtime smoke with the selected Winuxsh binary:
winuxsh tools/smoke_framework.winux .
```

The validator checks release documents, package index drift, release checksum
policy, bundle API and minimum Winuxsh metadata, old manifest inventory drift,
directory plugin inventory drift, plugin entry scripts, plugin metadata,
exported asset presence, parseable alias packs, parseable completion
definitions, prompt preset segment references, declarative keybinding metadata,
and theme TOML assets. Source manifests must declare `shell:source`, supported
lifecycle hooks, and a bundle-local `.winux` entry. Process manifests must be
explicit opt-in and declare protocol, command, timeout, permissions, and
required binaries. The package script builds
`dist/oh-my-winuxsh-{version}.zip` plus a `.sha256` checksum when run without
`--check`.
WASM manifests must also declare a bundle-local `.wasm` module path and SHA-256;
the validator checks that the artifact exists, matches the digest, and has a
valid WASM binary header. The current Winuxsh host can execute explicit command
modules that export `winuxsh_plugin_main() -> i32`, may write stdout/stderr,
may read simple command arguments, read cwd when `cwd:read` is declared, and
read explicitly permitted env values through `env:read:<NAME>` using the Phase
14-17 `winuxsh:plugin/host` imports; broader WASI and
shell-mutating host APIs remain future work.

Local release smoke test:

```sh
py tools\package_bundle.py
winuxsh plugin update oh-my-winuxsh --from dist\oh-my-winuxsh-1.0.1.zip --checksum-file dist\oh-my-winuxsh-1.0.1.zip.sha256
winuxsh plugin bundle status
winuxsh plugin search workflow
winuxsh plugin doctor
winuxsh plugin search workflow
```

first bundle release.
